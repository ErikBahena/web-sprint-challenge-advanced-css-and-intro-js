# Sprint Challenge: Advanced CSS and Intro to JavaScript - Influential Artists

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored advanced CSS and introductory JavaScript concepts. During this Sprint, you studied responsive web design, variable declaration, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, and objects. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating a website of influential artists with data from an object.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. Your work reflects your proficiency in Responsive Design, and JavaScript Basics.


## Introduction

In this challenge, you will use a data set of artists to build an "influential artists" webpage. This data comes from a set of "50 influential artists" on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time). We have reduced the data to just 20 artists to make it slightly easier to work with.

### Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. 

## Interview Questions
### (please edit this file and write your answer below each question.)

Please answer the following questions below, you may edit the readme file to include your answers below the question.

1. How would you describe acessibility on the web to someone new to programming?

    Imagine there's a website that has only green text on a red background. Can you think of anyone who would have trouble using this website? Exactly, color blind people would have issues reading the text on the website. "Accessibility" aims to make websites as friendly to users with different disabilities as possible. If someone is blind, you make your website more structured so screen readers can read your page. If you someone has bad vision, you make your font sizes scalable. This makes your site accessible.

2. Talk about 3 different things you can do to ensure your website is accessible. 

    Use semantic html so the screen reader knows to go down the page properly, also reading key information properly like links, buttons, addresses, headers, paragraphs, etc. 
    Use scalable font sizes like em or rem, so if your user changes their default brower font size, your site will scale as well. 
    Use colors that contrast well for color blindness, as well as avoiding black text on a white screen, this can be eye straining for viewers.


3. How would you explain the concept of a variable to someone new to programming?

    I have a box, in that box I place a candle. If I place that box in the attic somewhere it will be hard to find because there may be other boxes. So my solution is to name the box, perhaps with some marker. Something like "living room candle". Now I can easily find the candle using the named box as a reference to the candle. Variables allow us to store information about something and name it, like we named the box. Making it easier to find and reference our information. 

4. What is the purpose of using functions in code?

    Functions allow us to run some specific code at a specific time, rather then on the file loading. Like if I needed to do something after a user clicks a button, I wouldnt want that result of clicking the button to happen right when the page loads, I'd want that result to happen only when the button is clicked. Using a function also allows me to use the same code more than once. This makes your code more readable and more efficient. 

5. How do you access a key inside of an object inside of an array?
    my example: [{name: "erik"}], array[0].name
    technical response : array[index].key

You are expected to be able to answer questions in these areas. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. 

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set-Up

Follow these steps to set up your project:

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your forked version of the repo
3. cd into your repo and work on the main branch
NOTE: Tests will run for the JavaScript portion of this challenge only
4. connect to codegrade
5. open the terminal in your vs code and type `npm install`
6. next type `npm run test` in your terminal
7. Complete your work making regular commits, once you have all your tests passing and you are ready to submit your work please see canvas for instructions on how to submit

### Testing & Debugging

Open a second terminal inside of your project by clicking on the split terminal icon
![alt text](assets/split_terminal.png "Split Terminal")

Inside of your second terminal type `npm start` 
![alt text](assets/npm_start.png "type npm start")

You will be running your tests in one terminal and debugging in the other. As you work on your code you should make use of `console.log` to check your progress and debug.
![alt text](assets/tests_debug_terminal_final.png "your terminal should look like this")

### Task 2a:  Minimum Viable Product - Responsive Design

*Before you jump in, take 10 minutes to review the code that has already been provided for you. Take time to see how the home page was built. During this time, [Review the provided design files](design/). You have been provided all content necessary in the [index.html file](index.html) and basic styling in the [index.css file](css/index.css).*

* [ ] Ensure your website is responsive at 500px such that your styles match the [mobile design file](design/Mobile.png).

### Task 2b: Minimum Viable Product - JavaScript

Navigate to `index.js` and complete the MVP challenges. Note that you need to scroll past data (or collapse data in VScode) to find the challenges below.
